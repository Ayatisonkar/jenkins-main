Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates building, testing, and deploying software projects. It supports the
continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) principles, helping teams automate various stages of the software
development lifecycle.
PURPOSE
• Compatibility Improvement:
Jenkins helps in reducing compatibility issues between different software components by implementing measures that will ensure seamless
integration and operation of software across different platforms and configurations.
• Automation for Workload Reduction:
Jenkins minimizes manual workload in the testing and deployment processes to streamline repetitive tasks and increase efficiency.
• Accelerated Software Updates:
Jenkins can expedite the delivery of software updates to users, by utilizing continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for
faster and more reliable updates.
• Shared Defect Repository:
To Enhance collaboration between developers and operations in identifying and resolving defects, Jenkins
establish a shared repository accessible to both developers and operations (DevOps) for efficient tracking and resolution of software defects.
• Early Vulnerability Identification:
Instead of identifying and resolving vulnerabilities after they impact users, Jenkins takes security measures and conduct regular security audits to
proactively identify and address vulnerabilities in the software development life cycle.
• Minimum Specification required
Minimum hardware requirements:
• 256 MB of RAM
• 1 GB of drive space (although 10 GB is a recommended minimum if running Jenkins as a Docker container)
Recommended hardware configuration for a small team:
• 4 GB+ of RAM
• 50 GB+ of drive space
Software requirements:
• Java new version installed.
• Web browser: see the Web Browser Compatibility page
• For Windows operating system: Windows Support Policy
• For Linux operating system: Linux Support Policy
